          <h2>About Renewable Energy</h2>
          <p>Renewable energy is derived from natural resources that are constantly replenished, such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. These energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for combating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future.</p>

              <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
              <p>Solar energy harnesses sunlight to generate electricity through photovoltaic panels or to produce heat through solar thermal systems. It is a clean and abundant source of energy that can be deployed in various scales, from rooftop solar panels on homes to utility-scale solar farms.</p>

            <div class="technology-box">
              <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
              <p>Wind energy utilizes the power of the wind to generate electricity using wind turbines. Wind farms are often situated in areas with consistent wind patterns, such as coastal regions or open plains. Wind power is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources globally.</p>

            <div class="technology-box">
              <h2>Hydropower</h2>
              <p>Hydropower generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing water, typically from rivers, dams, or tidal movements. It is one of the oldest and most widely used renewable energy sources, providing reliable and sustainable power generation in many parts of the world.</p>

            <div class="technology-box">
              <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
              <p>Geothermal energy taps into heat stored beneath the Earth's surface to produce electricity or provide direct heating. Geothermal power plants utilize hot water or steam from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate clean, renewable energy.</p>

            <div class="technology-box">
              <h2>Bioenergy</h2>
              <p>Bioenergy is derived from organic materials such as biomass, biofuels, and biogas. It can be produced from a variety of sources, including agricultural residues, forestry waste, and organic waste. Bioenergy technologies offer versatile solutions for heat, electricity, and transportation fuel production.</p>

              <h2>Ocean Energy</h2>
              <p>Ocean energy, also known as marine energy, harnesses the power of the ocean's tides, waves, and currents to generate electricity. It is a renewable energy source with immense potential due to the consistent nature of ocean movements. Ocean energy technologies include tidal turbines, wave energy converters, and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems.</p>
