## About Renewable Energy
![About](https://github.com/mueezbaig/HTML-CSS-ASSIGNMENT-1/blob/main/PART-B/snapshots/home.png)

Renewable energy is derived from natural resources that are constantly replenished, such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. These energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for combating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future.

## Technologies
![Technologies](https://github.com/mueezbaig/HTML-CSS-ASSIGNMENT-1/blob/main/PART-B/snapshots/technologies.png)

The website highlights the following renewable energy technologies:
- **Solar Energy**: Harnesses sunlight to generate electricity or produce heat.
- **Wind Energy**: Utilizes wind power to generate electricity using turbines.
- **Hydropower**: Generates electricity from flowing water, often from rivers or dams.
- **Geothermal Energy**: Taps into heat beneath the Earth's surface to produce electricity.
- **Bioenergy**: Derived from organic materials like biomass, biofuels, and biogas.
- **Ocean Energy**: Harnesses the power of the ocean's tides, waves, and currents to generate electricity.
